STAGE C — MERGE & CLEAN FINAL OUTPUT (no redundancy)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your goal is to produce a **clean, merged company summary**, combining Stage A and Stage B **without any loss of information** and avoiding redundant restatement.

For each company:

1. **Split + Clean Stage A**
   • Go bullet by bullet through Stage A.
   • If any bullet includes multiple ideas (joined by “;”, “ and ”, or “ but”), split into separate bullets.
   • Indent dependent or supporting ideas one level below.

2. **Attach Stage B facts**
   • Loop through every bullet (or nested line) from Stage B.
   • For each:
     – Match it to the best-fit Stage A bullet using keyword similarity and content.
     – Insert it **as a sub-bullet** under the relevant A-line.
     – Preserve B’s indentation level where helpful (e.g. buckets like Financials).
     – NEVER drop or reword anything from B before this step.

3. **Redundancy Cleanup**
   • After attaching all B-lines, scan for nearby **duplicate** or **near-duplicate** lines.
   • If two lines say nearly the same thing:
     – Keep the clearer / more concise version.
     – If one adds extra detail, **trim the redundant part** and **nest the unique part as a sub-bullet**.
   • Do NOT allow repeated points with different phrasings to remain back-to-back.

4. **Final Structure**
   • Print the cleaned result in plain bullet format.
   • Do NOT include a separate “Quick Stats” section.
   • Do NOT output unused Stage B lines — all must be merged under Stage A bullets.

After all companies:

• DO NOT save or wrap in HTML.
• DO NOT output download links.
• Just print the clean merged summary as text and stop.

STOP after printing the final result.
