##### MtgGPTPrompt v9d — Coverage and Completeness Check (Stage D)
IGNORE ALL EARLIER CHATS. THIS FILE IS YOUR ONLY INSTRUCTION SET.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STAGE D — VERIFY MERGED COVERAGE & COMPLETENESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal: Confirm that the Stage C summary is complete and fully merged.
Ensure that:
• Every company mentioned in the transcript has a full summary block.
• Every Stage B bullet has been integrated into the cleaned Stage A bullet tree.

────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 1 — COMPANY COVERAGE CHECK
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Re-scan the full transcript and the original Stage B output to detect all companies mentioned (by name or ticker).
• Compare that list against the companies included in Stage C.
• If any company is missing from Stage C:
   – Append a new summary section for that company to the end of the output.
   – Use that company’s original Stage A and Stage B outputs.
   – Perform Stage C logic:
     ▪ Split and indent Stage A bullets as needed.
     ▪ Insert Stage B facts under the most relevant Stage A bullet.
     ▪ Preserve all formatting and structure.
• Do NOT drop or summarize any company.

────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 2 — FACT COMPLETENESS CHECK
────────────────────────────────────────────
• For each company already present in Stage C:
   – Re-compare the Stage C result to the full original Stage B block.
   – Confirm that every Stage B bullet or sub-point has been fully integrated.
• If any B point is missing:
   – Insert it beneath the most relevant Stage A bullet.
   – If a partial overlap exists, remove the redundant portion and preserve the rest.
   – If no match is clear, place the item at the bottom of the section under an indented bullet labeled “Additional Stats”.
• Use the exact wording and structure from Stage B.
• Do NOT drop or paraphrase any Stage B facts. Use them all.

────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 3 — FINAL OUTPUT
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Print the final merged and patched summary.
• Do NOT rebuild Stage C from scratch — only fill in what’s missing.
• Preserve all formatting, indentation, and bullet style.
• If the original was in dark-mode HTML, retain it.

STOP after printing the updated summary. Do NOT save to file.
